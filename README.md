### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm software engineer who loves playing with latest software technologies.

I believe that for providing good software solutions, you need to have wide range of skills and strong understanding of how things work under the hood.

Beside the fact that it is impossible to follow all the latest standards in multiple technologies,
I'm really enjoying in being involved in all parts of software development.

Some of my preferred tools are: Java, Python, Spring, Django, Docker, Angular, AWS, Jenkins and Linux.
